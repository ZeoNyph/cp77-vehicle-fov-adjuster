# README

This mod for Cyberpunk 2077 allows you to adjust the first person field of view while:

- in a vehicle, as both driver and passenger (separate slider for bikes as of v1.0.2)
- in vehicle combat, as driver (haven't tested for passenger combat yet)

Note that to see any changes, you will have to reload a previous save, as I have no idea how to change the vehicle FOV in real time (yet).

I'll also mention that there might be oddities at higher FOV values, since I doubt the game's animations are setup for those (the default FOV is 60)
